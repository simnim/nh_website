            <p>This app aims to bring a little joy to your day with cute animal pictures. All the content you'll see is taken directly from /r/aww. Credit goes to the original posters. Bookmark and check back in every few days for fresh top cats and dogs. </p>

            <p>Please note that this app is totally automated and relies on computer vision to figure out if a picture has a cat or dog in it. Of course sometimes these vision models get confused, but these mistakes are usually very interesting! If you spot a mistake, take a minute to wonder why the vision model got confused.</p>

            <p>TV is fun but a big time sink. Instead of wasting time and watching every episode, just watch the best. Save time, maximize your utility function, and get some culture while you're at it. This tool works best for your typical TV series, where each episode is self contained and there's little to no continuity between episodes.</p>

        <h1>About this site</h1>
            <p>My main profession is bioinformatics. This website has been my COVID19 <strike><i>lockdown</i></strike> vacation hobby project. I wanted to learn more about the state of the art in computer vision tooling and how to properly share that awesomeness with the world. I also wanted to launch my own website / blog. It's been a fruitful and interesting time learning about flask, opencv, tensorflow research models, aiosql, etc.</p>
